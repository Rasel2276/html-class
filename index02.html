<p style="color:purple">One of the most captivating natural places I have ever visited is Gazdağları.<br>
 Located in western Turkey, this region is often referred to as the lung of Turkey because of its oxygen-rich air and stunning natural beauty.<br> 
I visited Gazdağları during my master's thesis research, as my work required me to conduct geological studies in nature.
